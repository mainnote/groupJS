Instead of putting all attributes in a single object, it is recommended to create an object as a group object to manage and connect other objects called members. In the group object, there is a member list to maintain the relationship between group object and its members. Group object acts as a communicator between members. It also provides a single interface outside the group. Thus, object gets its own freedom of evolving its function without changing interaction of another object (class). \r\n\r\n### Why do I need groupJS\r\n\r\n(As you may already know that javascript takes prototypal inheritance, it creates flexible programming style. However, I am not a big fans of coding with .prototype. all the time (say composition). This method drains up my brain. Thus, I started looking for an implementation pattern fitting myself. \r\n\r\nAt first I jumped in the area of Backbone.js and its best friend marionette. They are kind of \"Event Driven\" as far as I understand, which turn object having receiving message function. They are surly a brilliant set. But I think they are still too flexible in terms of coding style. That is why I came up with a simple idea: \"Create a object group to bridge other objects.\")\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n### Take a look at basic code\r\n```javascript\r\nvar obj = {\r\n    create: function(name){\r\n        var newObj = Object.create(this);\r\n        if (!name && this.hasOwnProperty('name')) {\r\n            name = this.name; //name from originate during instance\r\n        }\r\n        newObj.name = name;\r\n        return newObj;\r\n    },\r\n    extend: function() {\r\n        for(var i=0; i<arguments.length; i++)\r\n            var extObj = arguments[i];\r\n            for(var key in extObj)\r\n                this[key] = extObj[key];\r\n    },\r\n    command: function() {\r\n        var self = this;\r\n        return function(cmd, opt) {\r\n            return self[cmd](opt);\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n    thisObj: function() { //for debug\r\n        return this;\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar group = obj.create('group');\r\ngroup.extend({\r\n    create: function(name) {\r\n        var newObj = obj.create.apply(this, arguments);\r\n        //all members should recreated within new group\r\n        newObj._buildMemberList();\r\n        \r\n        return newObj;\r\n    },\r\n    _buildMemberList: function() {\r\n        if (!this._memberList){ //base group\r\n            this._memberList = {};\r\n        }\r\n        else if (!this.hasOwnProperty('_memberList')) { //inherited group\r\n            var prototypeMemberList = this._memberList;\r\n            this._memberList = {}; //in object level memberList\r\n            for (var key in prototypeMemberList) {\r\n                var memberCmd = prototypeMemberList[key];\r\n                var newMember = memberCmd('create');\r\n                newMember.group = this; //member\r\n                \r\n                this._memberList[key] = newMember.command();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    join: function(member) {\r\n        //add new member in command interface\r\n        var newMember = member.create(member.name);\r\n        newMember.group = this;\r\n        this._memberList[member.name] = newMember.command();\r\n    },\r\n    call: function(memberName, methodName, opt) {\r\n        var memberCmd = this._memberList[memberName];\r\n        return memberCmd(methodName, opt);\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usages\r\n#### Object Inheritance\r\n\r\n* `obj.create(<object name>)` - Create a new object. <object name> should be identifier of an object. \r\n    ```javascript\r\n    var newObj = Grp.obj.create('newObj');\r\n    var newObj_1 = newObj.create('newObj_1');\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* `obj.extend( obj1 [, obj2, ......] )` - extend object's attributes. If attribute exists, it will be overriden.    \r\n    ```javascript\r\n    var newObj = Grp.obj.create('newObj');\r\n    newObj.extend({\r\n        newAttribute: function() {\r\n        alert('this is a new attribute');\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* `obj.command()` - return a function which provides simple and restricted interface.\r\n\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    var newObj = Grp.obj.create('newObj');\r\n    newObj.extend({\r\n        newAttribute: function(opt) {\r\n            alert('this is a new attribute for ' + opt.name||'');\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    var newObjCmd = newObj.command();\r\n    newObjCmd('newAttribute', { name: 'george' }); //calling the object\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n* `obj.thisObj` - for debug purpose, you may want to access object itself. There is an attribute \"thisObj\" to return object itself.\r\n\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    newObjCmd('thisObj'); //return newObj\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* `obj.parentNames` - Array to keep all inherited object's name.\r\n    \r\n#### Group\r\n* `group.join(<member or sub-Group>[, <member2 or sub-Group2>...])` - join a memeber into this group. If member name exists, the member will be overriden.\r\n\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    //create a member\r\n    var newObj = Grp.obj.create('newObj');\r\n    newObj.extend({\r\n        newAttribute: function(opt) {\r\n            alert('this is a new attribute for ' + opt.name||'');\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    //create a group\r\n    var newGrp = Grp.group.create('newGrp');\r\n    newGrp.join(newObj);\r\n    newGrp.extend({\r\n        promptAlert: function(opt) {\r\n            this.call('newObj', 'newAttribute', opt );\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    var grpTest = newGrp.create('grpTest').command();\r\n    var opt = { name: 'grpTest_Name' };\r\n    grpTest('promptAlert', opt);\r\n    ```\r\n* `group.call()`  - call its own member command. If inherited, the member will still be called based on parents list. return its result or the last call's result.\r\n\r\n    * For group level, `this.call(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)` \r\n    * For member level, `this.group.call(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)`\r\n    \r\n* `group.upCall()`  - call its own member command or find in upper group's member command.  First hit will be return.!!!\r\n\r\n    * For group level, `this.upCall(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)` \r\n    * For member level, `this.group.upCall(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)`\r\n    \r\n* `group.downCall()`  - call its own member command or find in sub group's member command. First hit will be return.!!!\r\n\r\n    * For group level, `this.downCall(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)` \r\n    * For member level, `this.group.downCall(<memberName>, <memberAttribute>, opt)`\r\n\r\n* `group.group` - for member, it refers to its group; for group, refers to its parent group.  \r\n\r\n* `group.setCallToMember(<memberName>, [<methodName>])`  - a convenient way to port all functions/single method of a specific member to group level\r\n\r\n    * <methodName> is optional.\r\n\r\n* `group.members()` - show a map of this group's members. This is to be used in `group.override(newMember, memberMap)` .\r\n\r\n* `group.getMember(memberName[, memberMap])` - get a member by name.\r\n\r\n* `group.override(newMember[, memberMap])` - override a member in this group. This function will go deep to each level and replace the member with the same name. If memberMap is specified, only the specified path will be search for overridden. \r\n\r\n* Case 1:  A group is instantial, its members will be instantial. At the meantime, if the group setCallToMember. It should set as well.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n1. [Check the test cases and you might get some idea](test/specs/global/globalSpec.js)\r\n2. [Check example folder](examples/)\r\n3.
