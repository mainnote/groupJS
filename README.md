## About groupJS

This project is intended to demostrate an alternative implementation pattern for javascript. GroupJS, as named, is an "inheritance" way grouping javascript objects together for instances. 

As you may already know that javascript takes prototypal inheritance, it creates flexible programming style (and gains better runtime interpretation performance in browser). However, I am not a big fans while coding with .prototype. all the time (say composition). This method drains up my small brain. Thus, I started looking for an implementation pattern fitting myself. 

At first I jumpped in the area of Backbone.js and its best friend marionette. They are kind of "Event Driven", as I understand so far, which turn object having receiving message function. They are surly a brilliant set. But I still think they are still too flexible in terms of coding style. That is why I came up with a simple idea: "Create a object group to bridge other objects."
